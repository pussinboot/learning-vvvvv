based off of stars.cpp from here: http://www.flipcode.com/archives/The_Art_of_Demomaking-Issue_02_Introduction_To_Computer_Graphics.shtml
not quite tho since vvvv is a little different and rather than doing stuff based on position of each individual pixel everything is sort of moving all on its own? idno hard 2 explain
and i cant really get the reset to be exactly the same as in the og source so instead we do a jitter thing that looks ok i guess
rly just wish i could get the absolute coordinates of things after drawing them lol
